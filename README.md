## About

This is an in-progress, 2D, top-down game built for Windows systems.
As of now, this project is more of a programming exercise and is not intended for distribution to consumers. This may change.
Direct2D (part of DirectX) is a graphics rendering API; it does not provide explicitly game-related functionality.
My implementation is unlikely to represent good programming or design practices.
